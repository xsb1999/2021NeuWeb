[{"title":"RRT","summary": "Three types of RRT algorithm","description": "RRT is a path planning method using in autonomous driving based on sampling.It can quickly search the entire state space (the real world) and is biased towards the unexplored space. It is very similar to trees with lots of limbs stretching out at each time.The main working flow is that we start from the start position and protrude some limbs randomly, once the limb of the tree reaches the destination, the path is found successfully.","type": "algorithm","language":"Python"},
